# Stairs

[felixgirault.github.io/stairs](https://felixgirault.github.io/stairs/)

A one-off project to help me tweak and visualize asymetric stairs as I would want to build them.
Coincitentally, this was a great way to get started with threlte.
There is really no point in making this open-source, but there is no reason not too either.
